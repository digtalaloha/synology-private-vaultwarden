# Run a private, LAN access only instance Vaultwarden On A Synology NAS With Docker-Compose

## Description

This repository will provide you the details to run a private, LAN access only, instance of Vaultwarden, using docker-compose, on a Synology NAS.  The setup will be using the Caddy web server that will obtain a Let's Encrypt cert for a subdomain that is setup through Duck DNS.

I referenced the following links for much of the setup.

* [Running a private vaultwarden instance with Letâ€™s Encrypt certs](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Running-a-private-vaultwarden-instance-with-Let%27s-Encrypt-certs)
* [Docker-compose Caddy with DNS challenge](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Using-Docker-Compose#caddy-with-dns-challenge)
